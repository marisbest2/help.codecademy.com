title: What version of Python do you teach?

Codecademy runs Python version 2.7.3. The reason we have not updated to Python3 is because Python3 is not fully backwards compatible with earlier versions and, as a result, hasn't yet seen wide adoption. We are always evaluating our standards and best practices and will make a decision about incorporating Python 3 into our curriculum as it becomes more prevalent in the tech community.

The differences between Python2 and Python3 are subtle but important. Python3 is not fully backwards compatible with Python2 as it changes how some of its core functionality works. For full details, see the [Python wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3).
